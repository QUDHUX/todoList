# todoList
An app that will help you keep track your plans

the to-do list has a beautiful UI, the user can add a to-do by filling the input and hit ENTER, after that he can rather check the to-do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString.
